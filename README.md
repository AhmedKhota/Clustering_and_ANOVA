# Clustering_and_ANOVA
Clustering and ANOVA for 2D data with sample weights using sklearn DBSCAN, Kmeans, and ANOVA.

Sounds were rated by subjects in an experiment. The sounds had their emotional valence and arousal inferred by a random forest model. A clustering analysis was done using the valence and arousal values to plot the data points (1 data point = 1 sound file). The clustering analyses was done using the subject ratings as sample weights. DBSCAN and Kmeans clustering analysis was done and ANOVA was performed on the clusters to assess the significance of the identified clusters.

The results of the analysis are presented below:
